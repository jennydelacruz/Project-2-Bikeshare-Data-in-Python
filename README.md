# Python-Project-2
In this project, part of Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with Python", I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

Through Python code, I imported the data and answered questions about each city, applying descriptive statistics. I also write a script that uses raw input in the terminal to present these statistics.

The Software I used was: 
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas using Anaconda; and Atom as my text editor. 

I first familiarized myself with the data included to provide the following, required information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
