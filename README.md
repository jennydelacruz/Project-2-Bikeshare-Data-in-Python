# Python-Project-2
In this project, part of Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with Python", I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

Through Python code, I imported the data and answered questions about each city, applying descriptive statistics. I also write a script that uses raw input in the terminal to present these statistics.

The Software I used was: 
Python 3, NumPy, and pandas using Anaconda; and Atom as my text editor. 

I first familiarized myself with the data included to provide the following, required information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
-most common month
-most common day of week
-most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
-most common start station
-most common end station
-most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
-total travel time
-average travel time

#4 User info
-counts of each user type
-counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
-earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
